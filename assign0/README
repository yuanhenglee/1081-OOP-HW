		   README for the sample directory
			    by Tsai-Yen Li


This directory serves as a sample directory for your homework
assignment. It contains several files described below:

1. Sample Makefile: read the comments in the Makefile. 

In most cases you only need to change a few line on the top of the
Makefile. This Makefile is designed to be platform independent for
UNIX systems. All platform related targets (e.g., *.o files) are either
stored in a subdirectory or suffixed with the architecture name (e.g.,
*_sun4).

2. Source Code: 

This part includes all the *.cc and *.h files of your implementation
except for the testing program. In C++, each .cc are coupled with a .h
file for various declaration purpose. I strongly encourage you to
follow this style. Optionally, these source programs can be grouped
into a package (library) for other people to use. 

3. Testing Program:

There should be a separated testing program that tests your
implementation. Obviously, this testing program is the one that
contains the main() function definition.

4. README file:

You should write a README file for each of your homework
assignment. It gives you the opportunity to explain your
implementation. Of course, if you do not prepare one, I will grade
your assignment according to the way I read your program and the
result of your executable.

5. Eletronic Submission:

For further information about submitting your assignment
electronically, please read the second handout. Good luck.
